The rise in remote work opportunities has been an unexpected but welcome result of the recent global turmoil. While this was limited to several industries, recent developments have quickly changed how we work and view remote employment.

Remote work enables companies to tap into a global talent pool while employees can access jobs without moving to central cities. Because remote workers now contribute to local economies in rural areas, this development also promoted economic growth there.

Despite how simple it is for businesses to employ globally, many still hesitate to work with a remote team out of worry for productivity or a lack of experience in hiring and managing a remote workforce.

Lack of experience is no longer an excuse since remote work is now available to everyone. The most talented workers of today demand the freedom to live and work wherever they please, and workers can gain from globalization just like the businesses that employ them.

With this, we will look at how remote work enables companies to expand globally because the time is now to take advantage of globalization's advantages and expand your international team.

## How Does Globalization Benefit Business?
The global interconnection of today is unprecedented in human history. Because of the blending of boundaries, companies of all sizes can hire workers from other countries in seconds.

**Establishing a Global Team to Enter New Markets**
While access to international markets is always just a click away, managing your company's expansion in those markets can be challenging. And maintaining a consistent global presence when dealing with many time zones, languages, and cultural norms can be a stretch.

But it's worth it to pursue those opportunities. Because of this, both large and small businesses can benefit significantly from having a global staff. Everyone can work from the convenience of their location and time zone, bringing all their local and cultural experiences instead of requiring weird work hours or forcibly moving people from place to place.

## Globalization Opportunities for Employers
The concerns about the effectiveness of remote work were disproved after companies transitioned to this kind of setup one by one. Working with remote workers boosts productivity, and most workers value the flexibility that remote work may provide. Modern solutions have made it simple and easy for distant teams to collaborate; for example, online resources are available, like books for [digital nomads](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themaverickshow.com/subscribe-top-nomad-books/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1697056974412833&usg=AOvVaw22vj6v9pl2pho11VMLlwYV). Suddenly, a global element is a part of any company's future.

**Increases Productivity**
The past years have shown that a physical workplace is optional for team cohesion or the caliber of work, even though maintaining a workplace culture with one is a little different.

Not only can people continue to be productive, but most can operate more effectively from home than they could in an office. Absenteeism and distractions decrease when there are no commutes or cubicles.

**Easy Collaboration Because of Technology**
With technology, it is simple to copy the office features that encourage collaboration and lessen the ones that don't. For instance, public documentation technologies enable staff to make projects and notes publicly accessible rather than using lengthy email chains.

Simply put, practice is the most significant barrier to adopting these tools. The more effectively your team can work asynchronously, which adds to productivity, the more your team will use these products with a remote-first attitude.

**Reduces Overhead**
Office space is one of the huge expenses for any business, after pay and benefits. You must not only hire an office that is big enough for your staff to work comfortably, but you must also keep the space maintained and stocked.

You can reduce your company's demand for office space by setting it up to operate remotely. Either entirely leave your workplace or lessen the employees that come each day. It means hybrid-working.

## Globalization Opportunities for Employees
Many workers, if any at all, don't wish to return to the workplace full-time. According to research from Remote, 81% of workers would relocate if they could without endangering their ability to advance in their careers. Remote working is a convenient advantage for the typical employee.

**No More Daily Commute**
People lose lots of time in their commutes to and from work. In certain places, traveling to work can take more than an hour one way. Even in small cities, it's typical for people to commute from the office to their house for at least 30 minutes each day, and that's if they don't go home for lunch. Each month, countless hours are saved by working remotely.

Reducing the daily commute will also help lessen carbon emissions from transport vehicles. This reduction is essential in fighting climate change, especially for people practicing sustainability daily. Additionally, there are solutions to help you accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions, like the [FLINT from Moja Global](https://moja.global/flint-101-why-we-built-flint/).

**Reduces Stress**
Even though working during a pandemic is unpleasant, regular remote work reduces stress. For instance, parents typically do not have to deal with school closings. Employees considering a move don't have to be as concerned about whether their housing decision may harm their jobs. Everyone gains when opportunities are global.

**Flexible Hours**
One of the best benefits of remote work is having the freedom to set your schedule. What does it matter if someone wants to take a long lunch or run a few errands when everyone works asynchronously? Employees feel more free when leadership focuses on meaningful metrics and evaluates staff based on production rather than hours worked.

## Final Thoughts
Now is the moment to broaden your recruiting search and take advantage of globalization's advantages. Employers and employees can profit from remote work because it gives you access to the best talent and improves the working environment for your loyal staff.
Working from anywhere is no longer a privilege but a necessity, particularly for the most skilled and in-demand professionals. Give your competitors no advantage by embracing globalization and making remote work your company's superpower.
